Back in my masterâ€™s in robotics days, I built a few tools to simplify creating, debugging, and simulating models and robots. Robotics workflows are rarely smooth, but my philosophy has always been: if itâ€™s painful to do once, try to do it only once.

So I Dockerized those tools and exposed them via [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). It began as a way to improve my research workflow, but soon I realized others might benefit too.

Fast forward eight years.

The site still works, and, to my surprise, over fifty people a month still use these tools.

I knew it was time to give the site some attention, but I didnâ€™t want to disrupt existing users.

What started as a quick cleanup turned into a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) rabbit hole. In hindsight, using Docker was a great decision back then. Since each tool was already containerized and stateless, they fit perfectly on [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run). I cleaned up the code, split the services, and redeployed them on infrastructure thatâ€™s more stable, scalable, and free under Cloud Runâ€™s generous tier. To [protect my budget](https://gist.github.com/hamzamerzic/8b834e56d2dc6a8f49bcb4047dd819df), I also set up a guardrail that stops serving if my monthly budget is reached.

The original toolbox lives on, now cleaner, faster, and more future-proof.

Find the tools under [Projects](https://hamzamerzic.info/projects/):

- ðŸ”§ [Mesh Cleaner](https://hamzamerzic.info/mesh_cleaner/)
  Clean and process 3D mesh files for physics-based simulations.
- ðŸ§¿ [Model Viewer](https://hamzamerzic.info/3d-viz/)
  Visualize 3D models and robots directly in your browser.
- ðŸ¤– [IKFast Generator](https://hamzamerzic.info/ikfast/)
  Generate analytic inverse-kinematics solvers from `.dae` files using OpenRAVEâ€™s IKFast.

These tools were invaluable during my masterâ€™sâ€”especially computing inertial properties for dozens of objects and cleaning up meshes for simulations. Later, during my research assistantship, I relied on the tools for inverse-kinematics work on robot manipulators. Fast, reliable tools like these really made a difference.

If youâ€™re still using any of theseâ€”thank you. I hope the migration went smoothly. If not, feel free to reach out and let me know whatâ€™s broken.

For nostalgia, hereâ€™s a little album of the old site:
