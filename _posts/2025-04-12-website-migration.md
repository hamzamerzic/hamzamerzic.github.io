Back in my robotics days, I built a few tools to make some of the tasks of creating, debugging, and simulating models for robotics a bit easier. These things are rarely smooth in robotics, but my philosophy has always been: if itâ€™s painful to do once, try to do it only once.

So I Dockerized those tools and exposed them via a WordPress site hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). It started as a way to make my research workflow easier, but I figured maybe others could benefit too.

Fast forward 8 years.

The site still works â€” and in hindsight, using Docker turned out to be a great decision. I was surprised to find that over 50 people a month still use these tools. (If you're one of them, say hi in the comments!)

I knew it was time to give the site some attention â€” but I didnâ€™t want to break things for existing users.

What started as a quick cleanup turned into a GCP rabbit hole. I realized that since each tool was already containerized and stateless, they were a perfect fit for [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run). I cleaned up the code, split the services, and redeployed them on infrastructure thatâ€™s more stable, scalable, and free to run thanks to Cloud Runâ€™s generous tier.

The original toolbox lives on â€” now cleaner, faster, and a bit more future-proof.

You can find the tools under [projects](https://hamzamerzic.info/projects/), running on modern infrastructure:

- ðŸ”§ [Mesh Cleaner](https://hamzamerzic.info/mesh_cleaner/): Clean and process 3D mesh files for use in physics-based simulations.
- ðŸ§¿ [Model Viewer](https://hamzamerzic.info/3d-viz/): Visualize 3D models and robots directly in your browser.
- ðŸ¤– [IKFast Generator](https://hamzamerzic.info/ikfast/): Generate analytic inverse kinematics solvers from `.dae` files using OpenRAVEâ€™s IKFast.

These tools helped a lot during my masterâ€™s â€” especially computing inertial properties for dozens of objects, and cleaning up mesh models for use in simulations. Later, during my research assistantship at ETH, I used them again while working on inverse kinematics and robot manipulators. Having fast, reliable tools for that kind of work made a real difference.

If you're still using any of these today â€” thank you. I hope the migration went smoothly. And if not, feel free to reach out and let me know if somethingâ€™s broken.

For nostalgia, I decided to keep a little album of what the old site looked like:

<style>
  .masonry-gallery {
    column-count: 2;
    column-gap: 1rem;
  }

  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    .masonry-gallery {
      column-count: 3;
    }
  }

  .masonry-gallery a {
    display: inline-block;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    width: 100%;
  }

  .masonry-gallery img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }
</style>
