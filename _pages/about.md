I'm a Staff Research Engineer at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) and a doctoral researcher at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). My work is focused on creating scalable AI systems and multimodal models capable of actively learning, understanding, and engaging with the real world. At DeepMind, I've led a team in developing a modular AI platform designed to accelerate research and foster collaboration, resulting in numerous scientific publications.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Sarajevo](https://www.unsa.ba/en), graduating as the top student of my generation. I continued my education at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), earning a Master's degree in Robotics, Systems and Control. I completed an external master's thesis at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) focused on learning to grasp by leveraging tactile sensors.

During my studies, I worked as a teaching and research assistant and spent a year interning at [Rapyuta Robotics](https://www.rapyuta-robotics.com/), where I developed navigation algorithms and worked on autonomous warehouse robots and end-to-end drone autonomy.

I'm passionate about strengthening the scientific community in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the broader region. I co-founded the [Association for the Advancement of Science and Technology (ANNT)](https://annt.ba/) to connect the brightest minds from Bosnia globally, inspiring them to contribute back to the region. Today, ANNT has grown to over 150 active members, one-third of whom hold PhDs or higher.

I'm also part of the organizing committee for this year's [Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.eeml.eu) (EEML), happening in Sarajevo.
