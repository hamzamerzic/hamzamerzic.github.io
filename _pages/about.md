I'm a Staff Research Engineer at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) and a doctoral researcher at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I work on building scalable AI systems and multimodal models that can actively learn, understand, and interact with the real world.

In a past life, I was deep in the world of robotics. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Sarajevo](https://www.unsa.ba/en), followed by a Masterâ€™s in Robotics, Systems and Control at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). My thesis, completed externally at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), focused on learning to grasp using tactile sensors.

Along the way, I worked as a teaching and research assistant and spent time at [Rapyuta Robotics](https://www.rapyuta-robotics.com/), where I developed navigation algorithms and worked on autonomous warehouse robots and end-to-end drone autonomy.

I'm passionate about strengthening the scientific community in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the broader region. I co-founded the [Association for the Advancement of Science and Technology (ANNT)](https://annt.ba/) to connect Bosnian talent around the world and work together on impactful contributions in the region.

I'm also part of the organizing committee for the [Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.eeml.eu) (EEML 2025) in Sarajevo.
