These things are rarely smooth in robotics, but my philosophy has always been: if itâ€™s painful to do once, try to do it only once.</p> <p>So I Dockerized those tools and exposed them via a WordPress site hosted on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>. It started as a way to make my research workflow easier, but I figured maybe others could benefit too.</p> <p>Fast forward 8 years.</p> <p>The site still works â€” and in hindsight, using Docker turned out to be a great decision. I was surprised to find that over 50 people a month still use these tools. (If youâ€™re one of them, say hi in the comments!)</p> <p>I knew it was time to give the site some attention â€” but I didnâ€™t want to break things for existing users.</p> <p>What started as a quick cleanup turned into a GCP rabbit hole. I realized that since each tool was already containerized and stateless, they were a perfect fit for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Google Cloud Run</a>. I cleaned up the code, split the services, and redeployed them on infrastructure thatâ€™s more stable, scalable, and free to run thanks to Cloud Runâ€™s generous tier.</p> <p>The original toolbox lives on â€” now cleaner, faster, and a bit more future-proof.</p> <p>You can find the tools under <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/projects/">projects</a>, running on modern infrastructure:</p> <ul> <li>ðŸ”§ <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/mesh_cleaner/">Mesh Cleaner</a>: Clean and process 3D mesh files for use in physics-based simulations.</li> <li>ðŸ§¿ <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/3d-viz/">Model Viewer</a>: Visualize 3D models and robots directly in your browser.</li> <li>ðŸ¤– <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/ikfast/">IKFast Generator</a>: Generate analytic inverse kinematics solvers from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dae</code> files using OpenRAVEâ€™s IKFast.</li> </ul> <p>These tools helped a lot during my masterâ€™s â€” especially computing inertial properties for dozens of objects, and cleaning up mesh models for use in simulations. Later, during my research assistantship at ETH, I used them again while working on inverse kinematics and robot manipulators. Having fast, reliable tools for that kind of work made a real difference.</p> <p>If youâ€™re still using any of these today â€” thank you. I hope the migration went smoothly. And if not, feel free to reach out and let me know if somethingâ€™s broken.</p> <p>For nostalgia, I decided to keep a little album of what the old site looked like:</p> <style>.masonry-gallery{column-count:2;column-gap:1rem}@media(min-width:768px){.masonry-gallery{column-count:3}}.masonry-gallery a{display:inline-block;margin-bottom:1rem;width:100%}.masonry-gallery img{width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:.5rem;box-shadow:0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)}</style> <div id="oldSiteCarousel" class="carousel slide carousel-fade mb-4" data-bs-ride="carousel"> <div class="carousel-inner"> <div class="carousel-item active"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-blog.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site blog"/> </div> <div class="carousel-item"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-home.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site home"/> </div> <div class="carousel-item"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-tools.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site tools"/> </div> <div class="carousel-item"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-mesh-cleaner.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site mesh cleaner"/> </div> <div class="carousel-item"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-ikfast.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site ikfast"/> </div> </div> <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#oldSiteCarousel" data-bs-slide="prev"> <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span> </button> <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#oldSiteCarousel" data-bs-slide="next"> <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span> </button> </div> <div class="caption mt-2"> A peek at the OG website.
