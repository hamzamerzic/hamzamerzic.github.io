Robotics workflows are rarely smooth, but my philosophy has always been: if itâ€™s painful to do once, try to do it only once.</p> <p>So I Dockerized those tools and exposed them via <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>. It began as a way to improve my research workflow, but soon I realized others might benefit too.</p> <p>Fast forward eight years.</p> <p>The site still works, and, to my surprise, over fifty people a month still use these tools.</p> <p>I knew it was time to give the site some attention, but I didnâ€™t want to disrupt existing users.</p> <p>What started as a quick cleanup turned into a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> rabbit hole. In hindsight, using Docker was a great decision back then. Since each tool was already containerized and stateless, they fit perfectly on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Google Cloud Run</a>. I cleaned up the code, split the services, and redeployed them on infrastructure thatâ€™s more stable, scalable, and free under Cloud Runâ€™s generous tier. To <a href="https://gist.github.com/hamzamerzic/8b834e56d2dc6a8f49bcb4047dd819df">protect my budget</a>, I also set up a guardrail that stops serving if my monthly budget is reached.</p> <p>The original toolbox lives on, now cleaner, faster, and more future-proof.</p> <p>Find the tools under <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/projects/">Projects</a>:</p> <ul> <li>ðŸ”§ <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/mesh_cleaner/">Mesh Cleaner</a> Clean and process 3D mesh files for physics-based simulations.</li> <li>ðŸ§¿ <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/3d-viz/">Model Viewer</a> Visualize 3D models and robots directly in your browser.</li> <li>ðŸ¤– <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/ikfast/">IKFast Generator</a> Generate analytic inverse-kinematics solvers from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dae</code> files using OpenRAVEâ€™s IKFast.</li> </ul> <p>These tools were invaluable during my masterâ€™sâ€”especially computing inertial properties for dozens of objects and cleaning up meshes for simulations. Later, during my research assistantship, I relied on the tools for inverse-kinematics work on robot manipulators. Fast, reliable tools like these really made a difference.</p> <p>If youâ€™re still using any of theseâ€”thank you. I hope the migration went smoothly. If not, feel free to reach out and let me know whatâ€™s broken.</p> <p>For nostalgia, hereâ€™s a little album of the old site:</p> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css"/> <style>.swiper{max-width:720px;margin:2rem auto;border-radius:.75rem;overflow:hidden}.swiper-slide img{width:100%;height:auto;aspect-ratio:4 / 3;box-shadow:0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)}.swiper-button-prev,.swiper-button-next{color:var(--global-theme-color);opacity:.4;transition:opacity .3s ease}.swiper-button-prev:hover,.swiper-button-next:hover{opacity:1}.swiper-pagination-bullet{background:var(--global-theme-color)}</style> <div class="swiper mySwiper"> <div class="swiper-wrapper"> <div class="swiper-slide"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-blog.png" alt="Old site blog"/> </div> <div class="swiper-slide"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-home.png" alt="Old site home"/> </div> <div class="swiper-slide"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-tools.png" alt="Old site tools"/> </div> <div class="swiper-slide"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-mesh-cleaner.png" alt="Old site mesh cleaner"/> </div> <div class="swiper-slide"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-ikfast.png" alt="Old site ikfast"/> </div> </div> <div class="swiper-button-next"></div> <div class="swiper-button-prev"></div> <div class="swiper-pagination"></div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.js"></script> <script>
