These things are rarely smooth in robotics, but my philosophy has always been: if it’s painful to do once, try to do it only once.</p> <p>So I Dockerized those tools and exposed them via a WordPress site hosted on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>. It started as a way to make my research workflow easier, but I figured maybe others could benefit too.</p> <p>Fast forward 8 years.</p> <p>The site still works — and in hindsight, using Docker turned out to be a great decision. I was surprised to find that over 50 people a month still use these tools. (If you’re one of them, say hi in the comments!)</p> <p>I knew it was time to give the site some attention — but I didn’t want to break things for existing users.</p> <p>What started as a quick cleanup turned into a GCP rabbit hole. I realized that since each tool was already containerized and stateless, they were a perfect fit for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Google Cloud Run</a>. I cleaned up the code, split the services, and redeployed them on infrastructure that’s more stable, scalable, and free to run thanks to Cloud Run’s generous tier.</p> <p>The original toolbox lives on — now cleaner, faster, and a bit more future-proof.</p> <p>You can find the tools under <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/projects/">projects</a>, running on modern infrastructure:</p> <ul> <li>🔧 <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/mesh_cleaner/">Mesh Cleaner</a>: Clean and process 3D mesh files for use in physics-based simulations.</li> <li>🧿 <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/3d-viz/">Model Viewer</a>: Visualize 3D models and robots directly in your browser.</li> <li>🤖 <a href="https://hamzamerzic.info/ikfast/">IKFast Generator</a>: Generate analytic inverse kinematics solvers from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dae</code> files using OpenRAVE’s IKFast.</li> </ul> <p>These tools helped a lot during my master’s — especially computing inertial properties for dozens of objects, and cleaning up mesh models for use in simulations. Later, during my research assistantship at ETH, I used them again while working on inverse kinematics and robot manipulators. Having fast, reliable tools for that kind of work made a real difference.</p> <p>If you’re still using any of these today — thank you. I hope the migration went smoothly. And if not, feel free to reach out and let me know if something’s broken.</p> <p>For nostalgia, I decided to keep a little album of what the old site looked like:</p> <style>.carousel-wrapper .carousel-control-prev,.carousel-wrapper .carousel-control-next{opacity:0;transition:opacity .3s ease}.carousel-wrapper:hover .carousel-control-prev,.carousel-wrapper:hover .carousel-control-next{opacity:1}</style> <div class="carousel-wrapper"> <div id="oldSiteCarousel" class="carousel slide mb-4" data-bs-ride="carousel" data-bs-interval="5000"> <div class="carousel-inner"> <div class="carousel-item active"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-blog.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site blog"/> </div> <div class="carousel-item"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-home.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site home"/> </div> <div class="carousel-item"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-tools.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site tools"/> </div> <div class="carousel-item"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-mesh-cleaner.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site mesh cleaner"/> </div> <div class="carousel-item"> <img src="/assets/img/old-site-ikfast.png" class="d-block w-100 rounded shadow-sm" alt="Old site ikfast"/> </div> </div> <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#oldSiteCarousel" data-bs-slide="prev"> <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span> </button> <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#oldSiteCarousel" data-bs-slide="next"> <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span> </button> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <div class="caption mt-2"> A peek at the OG website.
